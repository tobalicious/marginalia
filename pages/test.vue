      Exploring the Relationship between Workplace Freedom of Speech,
      Organizational Identification, and Employee Dissent
    </h1>
    <p>#Kassing #dissent</p>

      “... purpose... examine how subordinates perceptions of workplace freedom
      of speech related to their levels of organizational identification and
      their strategies for expressing dissent.” “Results indicated that
      organizational identification as well as expression of articulated dissent
      and latent dissent varied as a function of workplace freedom of speech”
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern organizations experimenting with more democratic and participative
      forms of organizing espouse desires to solicit employee feedback and envoy
      emend. BUT, this democratization of organizational structure does not
      necessarily equate to more democratic discourse in organizations. (Barker
      1993, 1994, Gorden, Holmberg and Hersey, 1994)
    </p>
    <p>
      Research has broken dissent messaging down into two categories:
      “personal-advantage” (disagreeing when one’s hours or cut, extra duties
      are required, or they are otherwise personally affected), and “principled
      dissent messages” (disagreement with business practices or decisions).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some studies found that managerial roles and argumentative ness predicted
      use of articulated dissent, and no management roles and verbal
      aggressiveness predicted latent dissent. Other studies also showed that
      higher-quality relationships with supervisors created more articulated
      dissent, and less latent dissent. Lower quality relationships, then,
      increased latent dissent. Employee satisfaction, employee commitment, and
      perception of personal influence were all positively related to
      articulated dissent and negatively related to latent dissent.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this to say, dissent is a multi-factored problem, and employees choose
      their dissent strategies in light of their organization’s influences on
      those factors.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Organizational Identification</strong></p>
    <p>
      (Tompkins and Cheney, 1985) “the act of [organizational] identification
      leads the decision maker to select a particular alternative, to choose one
      course of action over another”. Identification reduces the range of
      decisions by confining the choices available to alternatives associated
      with one’s targets of identification. Layman’s terms: when you choose your
      identity, you’re confining yourself to options available to someone with
      that identity. You then become biased to their targets of identification.
      Across and organizational level or these individual, the organization
      becomes more concerned with enticing decision makers to choose
      alternatives that are consonant with organizational values and goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      This organizational identification guides behavior by influencing which
      problems and alternatives appear most salient to organizational success.
      “A decision maker identifies with an organization when he or she desires
      to choose the alternative that best promotes the
      <em>perceived</em> interests of the organization”
    </p>
    <p>
      Research (Tompkins and Cheney 1985) show that highly identified employees
      reported using decision making premises that were aligned with
      organizational values, and low identifying employees used frameworks that
      did not resemble organizational values.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Bullis and Bach, 1991) found that organizational identification is a
      function of the nature and type of communication that occurs within
      organizations.
    </p>
    <h3 id="workplace-freedom-of-speech">Workplace Freedom of Speech</h3>
    <p>
      (Gorden and Infante 1987) suggest that supervisors that affirm
      subordinates’ self-concepts result in higher productivity, satisfaction
      and organizational commitment. They believe this is a function of acts of
      free speech and argumentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did not feel the need to salute ideas” is a good quote for organizational
      affirming behaviors. This comes from a study of W. L. Gore and Associates
      in Pacanowsky 1998. Saluting ideas is how I feel about growth mindset
      philosophies.
    </p>
    <p>
      If organizational identification is a function of communication, then it
      is a function of freedom of speech. It follows that organizations
      successfully build climates that generate freedom of speech, then voicing
      of opinions and dissent would become an organizational value and part of
      the organizational identification biases.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hypothesis of this paper is that “Employees who perceive more
      workspace freedom of speech exists in their organizations will report
      higher levels of organizational identification than employees who perceive
      less workplace freedom of speech.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Hypothesis two follows easily: “Employees who perceive more workplace
      freedom of speech exists in their organizations will report using more
      articulated dissent and less latent dissent than employees who perceive
      less workplace freedom or speech exists”
    </p>
    <h3 id="results-and-discussions">Results and Discussions</h3>
    <p>
      Data showed strong support for both hypotheses: Organizational
      identification and choices about how they expressed dissent varied with
      their <em>perceptions</em> of workplace freedom of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also support in the data that democratic discourse and higher
      levels of freedom of speech is “as crucial or more crucial” than
      structures that are democratic. It is possible to achieve an “aura” of
      democracy without these structures in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previous research suggests that perceptions of loyalty and similarity are
      key components of organization identification (Johnson, Johnson &amp;
      Heimberg, 1999). The research here could imply a further relationship to
      freedom of speech.
